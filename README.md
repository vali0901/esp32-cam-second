#### ESP32-CAM Videostreaming project

The files are structured as follows:

* data folder includes the initial state of the files contained into the esp32's filesystem; there we have the config files (tokens and wifi connection settings) and web interface files (html, css and js)
* src contains the code and the headers used, data_server contains the initializations and useful functions for DATA MODE, config_server does the same for CONFIG MODE
